Large language models like ChatGPT have become commonplace tools, helping us write emails as well as code. Other times, though, one LLM is not sufficient to manage complex, multistep tasks. That is where "multi-agent systems" come in.

## What Are Multi-Agent LLM Systems?

Simply stated, an agent system is like having multiple specialist AI agents working together to accomplish an objective. Think in terms of project work where individuals have specific talents. In most situations, there is often one "boss" agent that over sees the team to assign individual tasks to individual "sub-agents."

For example, suppose that you have to prepare a research report:

1. A **Research Agent** gathers relevant data from the internet.
2. The **Writer Agent** processes this information to create the report.
3. The draft goes through review and polishing by an **Editor Agent**.
4. A **Summarizer agent** creates a short summary of the final report.

The Supervisor Agent organizes all this by assigning tasks to the respective agents and collating their results to deliver to you.

## Why Utilize Multi-Agent Systems? What Are the Benefits?

Instead of relying on a single AI to carry out all tasks, task allocation between specialist agents has numerous benefits:

- **Expertise:** Each agent has an area of specialty (e.g., coding, translation or data analysis), leading to higher-quality results.
- **Multistep workflows:** Steps in tasks that have more than one step (e.g., product concept creation, market research, preparation of presentations) become more manageable. The flow is coordinated by the supervisor.
- **Scalability & Modularity:** Sub-problems of complex tasks are broken down. Integrating new, specialist agents is easy, or existing ones can simply be modified.
- **Enhanced Quality Output:** Through concentrated capabilities of task-specific agents for individual sections of an inquiry, overall performance in terms of output is improved.
- **Flexibility:** Any combination of agents can perform more than one task.

## Are there Any Disadvantages or Challenges?

Like any technology, multi-agent systems have potential challenges:

- **Coordination Complexity:** Coordination between agents involves delegating tasks, including communication, that adds complexity.
- **Dealing with errors:** A single agent's mistake or miscommunication can influence all processes, so that it's hard to pinpoint where the issue is.
- **Cost:** Deploying multiple agents can potentially be computationally more expensive than deploying one. Fortunately, modern architectures like VoltAgent provide solutions to these limitations.

## How Do Multi-Agent Systems Interact with VoltAgent?

VoltAgent is an effective tool for creating AI agents, and multiple agents can be developed simply using **Supervisor Agents** and **Subagents**.

1. **Define Agents:** You define your subagents that specialize in a particular task (e.g., "Story Writer" agent, "Translator" agent). An agent consists of a name, description (instructions), and LLM that it uses.
2. **Build the Supervisor:** Second, build the supervisor agent that will manage these subagents. In defining the supervisor, simply specify which subagents it will manage using the `subAgents` parameter.
3. **Automatic Installation:** Whenever you install a supervisor agent, VoltAgent automatically configures the following in the background:

- It revises the supervisor's system message (i.e., its basic instructions) to include instructions on treating its subagents.
- Includes in the supervisor an additional `delegate_task` tool that allows it to delegate tasks to subagents.
- Holds records for agent relations.

4. **Task Flow:**

- You forward your request to the supervisor agent.
- The supervisor reviews the request to select which subagents will most effectively accomplish the task.
- Uses `delegate_task` to delegate the task(s) to the corresponding subagents.
- Subagents carry out their assignments and report their results to the supervisor.
- The supervisor will combine results from all subagents and provide the final answer to you.

## A Practical Example with VoltAgent

Let's build the story writing and translation example. First, you'll need a VoltAgent project. You can create one easily using the command line:

```bash
npm create voltagent-app@latest my-multi-agent-project
cd my-multi-agent-project
```

Before proceeding, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your `my-multi-agent-project` directory and add your key like this:

```dotenv
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual OpenAI API key. VoltAgent will automatically load this key.

This command sets up a basic VoltAgent project structure 🎉

Now, you can modify the agent logic (typically in a file like `src/index.ts` or similar within the new project) to implement our supervisor and subagents:

```typescript
// Inside your VoltAgent project (e.g., src/index.ts)
import { VoltAgent, Agent } from "@voltagent/core";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// 1. Create Subagents
const storyWriter = new Agent({
  name: "Story Writer",
  description: "You are an expert at writing creative and engaging short stories.",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

const translator = new Agent({
  name: "Translator",
  description: "You are a skilled translator, proficient in translating text accurately.",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

// 2. Create the Supervisor Agent (linking subagents)
const supervisorAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Supervisor Agent",
  description:
    "You manage workflows between specialized agents. " +
    "When asked for a story, use the Story Writer. " +
    "Then, use the Translator to translate the story. Present both versions to the user.",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  // Connect the subagents here
  subAgents: [storyWriter, translator],
});

new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    supervisorAgent,
  },
});
```

After saving this code (e.g., in `src/index.ts`), open your terminal in the project directory (`my-multi-agent-project`) and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, start the VoltAgent development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output similar to this in your terminal, indicating the server is running:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  VOLTAGENT SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ HTTP Server: http://localhost:3141

  Developer Console:    https://console.voltagent.dev
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to the **Developer Console** URL shown (https://console.voltagent.dev).

Inside the console:

1.  You should see your agents listed. Click on **"Supervisor Agent"**.
2.  In the agent details view, click the chat icon (usually in the bottom right).
3.  Type your request into the chat input: `Write a short story about a robot learning to paint and translate it to German.` and press Enter.

![Multi-Agent LLM Example](https://cdn.voltagent.dev/2025-04-23-multi-agent-llm/multi-agent-llm-demo.gif)

The Supervisor Agent will now execute the workflow: it will first delegate the story writing task to the `Story Writer` subagent, then delegate the translation task to the `Translator` subagent, and finally present both results in the chat interface. VoltAgent handles all the background coordination automatically.

## Conclusion

The future generation of AI capabilities is embodied in Multi-agent LLM systems. They break hard challenges down, combine multiple areas of knowledge, and permit more powerful, more flexible solutions. VoltAgent is such an instrument that simplifies designing and embedding these sophisticated systems. Are you all set to build your AI team?
