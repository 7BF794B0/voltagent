## Introduction

Something very interesting is happening in the AI development world lately. We used to try to handle everything with one big AI model. Now we can bring together AI agents with different specialties and run them as a team.

One of the leading names in this field is **CrewAI**. With this Python framework developed by Jo√£o Moura, you can organize your AI agents just like in a real office. Each agent has its own special role - one is a researcher, another is an analyst, and another is a writer.

## From Old-Style AI to Smart Agents

Remember when we used to ask ChatGPT something and only get a text response? Those days are behind us. Now AI doesn't just talk, it actually does work.

How does this happen? Think about it this way: While normal AI can only chat, agents can:

Make work plans - They plan by themselves "How should I do this job?"
Use tools - They connect to databases, call APIs, make calculations
Remember past experiences - They learn from work they did before
Make decisions alone - They automatically find answers to "What should I do in this situation?"

So AI is no longer just a question-answer machine, but has become real collaborative assistants.

## Why One Agent Is Not Enough?

Think about it: in a company, can one person be an accountant, marketer, and developer all at once? Of course not. The same logic applies to AI agents.

Problems we face when working with a single agent:

- Gets crushed under too much workload
- Can't be an expert in everything, stays superficial
- When it makes a mistake somewhere, the whole job fails
- Gets stuck when big projects come

That's why multi-agent systems like CrewAI make so much sense. Just like in real life, everyone has their own special job.

For example, when preparing a blog post:

- Research agent deeply investigates the topic
- Editor agent reviews and organizes the writing
- SEO specialist agent optimizes keywords

Everyone does their own job, talks to each other, and in the end a great output emerges. Just like good teamwork.

## Inside CrewAI

To understand CrewAI, think of a movie set. Just like in a movie there are different roles like director, cameraman, sound technician, in CrewAI each agent has its own special task.

CrewAI, built on LangChain technology, works with quite simple logic. When creating each agent, you define three things:

```python
agent = Agent(
    role='Data Scientist',
    goal='Analyze customer data and provide insights',
    backstory='You are an experienced data scientist. You are an expert in machine learning and statistics.'
)
```

So each agent has:

- What role it plays (role)
- What it tries to achieve (goal)
- What experiences it comes with (backstory)

That simple!

### Preparing Agent Toolboxes

Just like a mechanic needs different tools, each agent needs its own special tools. CrewAI offers really rich possibilities in this area.

Some examples of ready-made tools:

- Tools that can search in JSON files
- Tools that do code research on GitHub
- Tools that scan YouTube channels
- Tools that can run terminal commands

Of course, you can also make your own custom tools. Connecting to APIs, making special calculations, setting up cache systems - you can do whatever is needed.

### Describing Tasks

You need to clearly tell each agent what to do. Just like when giving a job description to an employee:

```python
data_collection = Task(
    description='Collect data from customer interactions',
    expected_output='Organized dataset for analysis',
    agent=data_science_agent,
)
```

You can have tasks done sequentially or at the same time, and you can give results from one to the next task as input. You can also get results in the format you want (JSON, file, etc.).

### Organizing Your Workflow

There are three different working styles in CrewAI:

**Sequential Work**: Like an assembly line. The first agent finishes its job, gives the result to the second, then to the third... Classic workflow.

**Hierarchical Work**: A manager agent is automatically created and it distributes everyone's work. Think of it like company hierarchy.

**Consensus**: (Still being developed) Agents will make decisions by voting among themselves. A democratic approach.

### Building the Team

In the final step, you bring everyone together:

```python
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_scientist, researcher, writer],
    tasks=[analyze_task, research_task, write_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
)
```

And voil√†! Your team is ready.

## LLM Integration and Flexibility

One of CrewAI's biggest advantages is LLM flexibility:

- **OpenAI GPT-4** (default)
- **Google AI** models
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **IBM Granite** series
- **Local models** (with Ollama)
- **Any LangChain compatible** model

This flexibility allows you to choose different LLMs for different agents. For example, you can use Code Llama for a coding agent and GPT-4 for a writing agent.
